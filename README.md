# LiveSplit.StreamDeck

Using `LiveSplit.Server` to control livesplit via your streamdeck.

Sooooooooooooo, turns out that browsers do not support raw TCP sockets. And the stream deck app is chrome. Stay tuned to see what I come up with to get around this :)

## Why
I always find myself accidentally hitting hotkeys when typing stuff out because I want keep the key combos simple.
Because of my unwillingness to assign more than 1 key to a hotkey (if I manually have to trigger it) I'm not a fan of them.
That is why I decided to build this plugin, just so I don't have to sacrifice hotkeys for livesplit.

## WIP
This streamdeck plugin is currently under construction, please check back later :)
