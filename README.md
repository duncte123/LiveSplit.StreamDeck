# LiveSplit.StreamDeck

Using `LiveSplit.Server` to control LiveSplit via your Stream Deck.

## Why
I always find myself accidentally hitting hotkeys when typing stuff out because I want keep the key combos simple.
Because of my unwillingness to assign more than 1 key to a hotkey (if I manually have to trigger it) I'm not a fan of them.
That is why I decided to build this plugin, just so I don't have to sacrifice hotkeys for livesplit.

## WIP
This streamdeck plugin is currently under construction, please check back later :)
